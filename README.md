# Encrypt-and-decrypt

Workflow:

Initial image is stored in internal memory and the secret keys are read from txt file.
There are generated random numbers, then a permutation and pixels are permuted
The given array elements are xor-ed with a certain formula
Image obtained is saved in external memory
Semi-cripted image is stored in internal memory and secret keys are read from txt file
It is generated an array of random elements, then a permutation and it is made an inverse permutation of pixels
It is applied xor after a certain formula
Cripted image is now saved in external memory
Chi squared test is calculated and results are shown to the user
